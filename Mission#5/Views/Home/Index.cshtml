        The history of rock climbing is as follows: 
        Rock climbing evolved from 19th-century European mountaineering into a distinct sport, 
        shifting from early aid-based, piton-heavy ascents to "clean climbing" (using removable
        protection) in the 1970s and modern, free-climbing, and bouldering styles. Key milestones 
        include the development of Yosemite's "Big Wall" era in the 1950s/60s, the introduction
        of sticky rubber shoes in the 1980s, and the rise of competition climbing, culminating 
        in the 2020 Olympics.

        More stuff on rock climbing.
        Rock climbing evolved from a 19th-century mountaineering necessity into a global sport, 
        transitioning from early, risky, aided ascents in the European Alps and UK to modern, 
        technical free climbing. Key developments include the 1886 ascent of Napes Needle, the 
        invention of specialized gear like carabiners (1910) and sticky rubber shoes (1980), 
        and the rise of bouldering and sport climbing in the late 20th century, culminating 
        in Olympic inclusion.
